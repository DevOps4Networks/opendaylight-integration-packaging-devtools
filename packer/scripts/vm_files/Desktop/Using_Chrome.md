Chrome should be launched by double clicking on the Chrome Icon on the desktop.

When launched, you should opt to make Chrome the default browser.

After Chrome is started, press Chtrl-Shift-B to show the bookmarks, where you will see bookmarks for, amongst others, downloading ODL and installing Postman, which is a tool for using REST APIs.

You should install Postman by clicking on the bookmark, and then clicking on "Add to Chrome". Subsequently you can click on the same bookmark to launch Postman.

After having read the README file, you may want to download ODL bundle. The "Downloads | OpenDaylight" bookmark will take you to the right page for that.
